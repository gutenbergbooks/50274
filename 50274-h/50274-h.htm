      HE little house, tell this story. It was lived within my walls; not a line
      is invented and it was I, by my interfering, who brought about the happy
      ending. Who wants a story that does not end happily, especially a
      Christmas story? To have been responsible for the happy ending is pretty
      nearly as clever as to have made the story up out of one's own head or, as
      we houses say, out of one's own walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps you never heard before of a house telling a story. If that be so,
      it is because you don't listen or because you go to bed too early. Unlike
      people, we houses sleep all day long; but after midnight we wake up and
      talk. When the clock strikes twelve, our stairs begin to crack and our
      windows to rattle and our floors to creak. If you ever hear these sounds,
      don't be frightened; they simply mean that the kind old walls that shelter
      you have begun to remember and to think. And we have so many things to
      remember and to think about, especially we old houses who have been
      standing for almost two hundred years. We have seen so much; we have been
      the friends of so many generations. More little children have been born
      beneath our roofs than we have stairs on which to count. We reckon things
      on our stairs, just as people reckon things on their fingers. When our
      stairs crack after midnight, it's usually because we're counting' the
      births and love-makings and marriages we have watched. We very often get
      them wrong because there are so many of them. Then the doors and windows
      and floors will chip in to correct us. &ldquo;Ha,&rdquo; a window will rattle, &ldquo;you've
      forgotten the little girl who used to gaze through my panes in 1760 or
      thereabouts.&rdquo; One of the doors will swing slowly on its hinges and, if
      anyone disputes with it, will bang, shouting angrily, &ldquo;Wrong again&mdash;all
      wrong.&rdquo; Then the walls and the windows and the doors and the floors all
      start whispering, trying to add up correctly the joys and sorrows they
      have witnessed in the years beyond recall.

      When that happens, if you're awake and listening, you'll hear us start
      adding afresh, from the lowest to the topmost stair.

      I am a London house and a very little house, standing in a fashionable
      square near Hyde Park. I have known my ups and downs. Once was the time
      when I was almost in the country and the link-boys used to make a fuss at
      having to escort my lady so far in her sedan-chair. It's a long way to the
      country now, for the city has spread out miles beyond me. Within sight
      through the trees at the end of the square red motor-buses pass, bumping
      their way rowdily down to Hammersmith and Kew. In my young days these
      places were villages, but I am told they are full of noises now. I have at
      least escaped that, for our square is a backwater of quiet and leads to
      nowhere, having an entrance only at one end. All the houses in the square
      were built at the same time as I was, which makes things companionable. We
      all look very much alike, with tiny areas, three stone steps leading up
      from the pavement, one window blinking out from the ground-floor, two
      blinking out from each of the other floors and a verandah running straight
      across us. In summer-time the verandah is gay with flowers. Our only
      difference is the colour we are painted, especially the colour of our
      doors. Mine is white; but some of our neighbours' are blue, some green,
      some red. We're very proud of the front-doors in our square. In the middle
      stands a railed-in garden, to which none but our owners have access. Its
      trees are as ancient as ourselves. Behind us, so hidden that it is almost
      forgotten, stands the grey parish-church, surrounded by a graveyard in
      which many of the people who have been merry in us rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some years we were what is known as a &ldquo;gone down neighborhood,&rdquo; till a
      gentleman who writes books bought us cheap, put us in repair and rented us
      to his friends. This has made us very select; since then we have become
      again fashionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you know all that is necessary to form a mental picture of us. Because
      we are so small, we are sometimes spoken of as &ldquo;Dolls' House Square.&rdquo; All
      the things that I shall tell you I do not pretend to have witnessed, for
      houses have to spend their lives always in the one place&mdash;they cannot
      ride in taxis and move about. We gain our knowledge of how the world is
      changing by listening to the conversations of people who inhabit us; when
      night has fallen we mutter among ourselves, passing on to one another
      beneath the starlight down the lamp-lit streets the gossip we have
      overheard. Whatever of importance we miss, the churchbells tell us. Big
      Ben, with his sweet tenor voice, booming out the hours, is in this respect
      particularly thoughtful.

      wanted rest.

      HE little lady who needed to be loved, but did not know it, discovered me
      quite by accident. This story is a series of accidents; if it had not been
      for the <i>ifs</i> and the <i>perhaps's</i> and the <i>possibilities</i>
      there wouldn't have been any story to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was empty when she found me, for my late tenants had grown frightened
      and had moved into the country on account of airraids. They said that I
      was too near the giant searchlights and anti-aircraft guns of Hyde Park
      Corner to be healthy. If they weren't killed by bombs, sooner or later
      they would be struck by our own expended shell-cases that came toppling
      from two miles out of the clouds. So they had made their exit hurriedly in
      November, taking all their furniture and leaving me to spend my
      one-hundred-and-ninety-eighth Christmas in the company of a caretaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was shortly before Christmas when I first saw her. Night had settled
      peacefully down; it was about nine o'clock when the maroons and sirens
      began to give warning that the enemy was approaching. In an instant, like
      a lamp extinguished, the lights of London flickered and sank. Down the
      forests of streets innumerable doors swiftly opened and people came
      pattering out. Dragging half-clad children by the hand and carrying babies
      snatched up from their warm beds, they commenced to run hither and
      thither, seeking the faint red lights of shelters, where cellars and
      overhead protection might be found. Policemen, mounted on bicycles, rode
      up and down the thoroughfares, blowing whistles. Ambulances dashed by,
      tooting horns and clanging bells. From far and near out of the swamp of
      darkness rose a medley of panic and sound. Prodding the sky, like
      detectives with lanterns, searchlights hunted and turned back the edges of
      the clouds. Then ominously, with solemn anger, the guns opened up and in
      fierce defiance the first bomb fell. The pattering of feet ceased
      suddenly. Streets grew forlorn and empty. The commotion of living and the
      terror of dying were transferred from the earth to the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was standing deserted with my door wide open, for at the first signs of
      clamour the old woman, who was supposed to take care of me, had hobbled up
      from her basement and out on to the pavement in search of the nearest Tube
      Station. In her fear for her safety, she had forgotten to close my door,
      so there I stood with the damp air drifting into my hall, at the mercy of
      any chance vagrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guns had been booming for perhaps five minutes when I heard running
      footsteps entering the square. Our square is so shut in and small that it
      echoes like a church; every sound is startling and can be heard in every
      part of it. I could not see to whom the footsteps belonged on account of
      the trees and the darkness. They entered on the side farthest from me,
      from the street where the red motor-buses pass. When they had reached the
      top, from which there is no exit, they hesitated; then came hurrying back
      along the side on which they would have to pass me. <i>Tip-a-tap,
      tip-a-tap, tip-a-tap</i> and panting breath&mdash;the sound of a woman's
      high-heeled shoes against the pavement. Accompanying the <i>tip-a-tap</i>
      were funny, more frequent, shuffling noises, indistinct and confused.
      Three shadows grew out of the gloom, a small one on either side and a
      bigger one in the centre; as they drew near they resolved themselves into
      a lady in an evening-wrap and two children.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was more glad than I cared to own, for I'd been feeling lonely. Now that
      peace has come and we've won the war, I don't mind acknowledging that I'd
      been feeling frightened; at the time I wouldn't have confessed it for the
      world lest the Huns should have got to know it. We London houses, trying
      to live up to the example of our soldiers, always pretended that we liked
      the excitement of airraids. We didn't really; we quaked in all our bricks
      and mortar. One's foundations aren't what they were when one is a
      hundred-and-ninety-eight years old. So I'm not ashamed to tell you that I
      was delighted when the lady and her children came in my direction. I tried
      to push my front-door wider that they might guess that they were welcome.
      I was terribly nervous that they might pass in their haste without seeing
      that I was anxious to give them shelter. It was shelter that they were
      looking for. In coming into the square they had been seeking a shortcut
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drew level without slackening their steps and had almost gone by me
      when, less than a quarter of a mile away, a bomb crashed deafeningly.
      Everything seemed to reel. Far and near you could hear the tinkling of
      splintered glass. The world leapt up red for a handful of seconds as
      though the door of a gigantic furnace had been flung open. Against the
      glow you could see the crouching roofs of houses, the crooked chimney-pots
      and the net-work of trees in the garden with their branches stripped and
      bare. The lady clutched at my railings to steady herself. Her face was
      white and her eyes were dark with terror. The last bomb had been so very
      close that it seemed as though the next must fall in the square itself.
      One of the searchlights had spotted the enemy and was following his plane
      through the clouds, holding it in its glare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mummy, it's all right. Don't be frightened. You've got me to take care of
      you.&rdquo; It was the little boy speaking. Then he saw my <i>To Let</i> sign
      above and pointed, &ldquo;We'll go in here till it's over. Look, the door's wide
      open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tugged on her hand. With her arm about the shoulder of the little girl
      on the other side of her, she followed. The glow died down and faded. Soon
      the square was as secret and shadowy as it had been before&mdash;a tank
      full of darkness in which nothing stirred.

    <p>
      EVER since I had been built had any visit quite as unceremonious as this
      occurred. Who was the strange lady? What was she doing wandering the
      streets at this hour unescorted? She was beautiful and richly gowned; her
      face was young, but very sad. I was anxious to learn more, so I listened
      intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first on entering, they halted just across the threshold, huddled
      together, the little lady with an arm flung about each of the children.
      She seemed to think that someone might be hidden in the darkness watching&mdash;someone
      to whom I belonged&mdash;for presently she addressed that supposed someone
      tremblingly: &ldquo;We hope you don't mind, but the car forgot to come for us.
      Grandfather had been giving us a party. When we heard the warning, we
      tried to run home before the raid started; but we got lost. The Tube
      Stations were all so crowded that... And we found your door open, so we
      hope you don't mind us entering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused nervously, waiting for someone to answer. A board creaked;
      apart from that the silence was unbroken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking to herself more than to the children, &ldquo;It's quite empty,&rdquo; she
      said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I close the door, Mumsie?&rdquo; the little boy questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Robbie darling,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;they might be angry, when they come
      back. I mean the people who live here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's dreadfully cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let's go farther in and find somewhere to sit down till the raid is
      over.&rdquo; They stumbled their way in the darkness through the hall and up the
      narrow staircase, where only one can walk abreast. Robbie went first on
      this voyage of discovery; he felt that if anything were hiding from them,
      his body would form a protection. His mother didn't want to lose sight of
      the street by climbing higher, but he coaxed her on from stair to stair.
      As pioneer of the expedition, he reached the tiny landing with the single
      door, which gives entrance to the drawing-room which occupies the whole of
      the second storey. Turning the handle he peeped in warily. Then, &ldquo;Cheer
      up, Mummy,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;there's been a fire and there's a wee bit of it
      still burning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The room was carpetless and bare of furniture, save for an old sofa with
      sagging springs that had been pulled up across the hearth. Perched on the
      bars of the grate sat a tin kettle, gasping feebly, with nearly all its
      water boiled away. Under the kettle a few coals glowed faintly and a weak
      flame jumped and sank, like a ghost trying to make up its mind to vanish.
      Through the tall French windows that opened on to the verandah one could
      see the sky lit up with the tumultuous display of monstrous fireworks.
      From high overhead, above the clatter of destruction and the banging of
      guns, came the long-drawn, contented humming of the planes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're right over us,&rdquo; the little boy whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if afraid that any movement on their part would draw the enemy's
      attention, they stood silent, clinging together, and listened. Oblongs of
      light, falling through the windows, danced and shifted. Once the beam of a
      searchlight groping through the shadows, gazed straight in and dwelt on
      them astounded, as if to say, &ldquo;Well, I never! Who'd have thought to find
      you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They tiptoed over to the couch and sat down, making as little noise as
      possible, for they still weren't sure that they were welcome. They didn't
      speak or move for some time; with the excitement and running and losing
      their way they were very tired. Presently the little boy got up, and went
      and stood by the window looking out, with his legs astraddle and his hands
      behind his back like a man. He wore a sailor-suit and had bare, sturdy
      knees. He was very small to try to be so manly.

    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not frightened, Mummy,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If father were here, he wouldn't be frightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shifted her position so that she could glance proudly back at him.
      &ldquo;Father was never frightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time the little girl spoke. &ldquo;If father were here, they
      wouldn't dare to come to London. I expect they knew...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Joan,&rdquo; her mother interrupted quickly, &ldquo;I expect they knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when I'm a man they won't dare to come to London, either,&rdquo; said
      Robbie. &ldquo;How many of them did father...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at that moment, before he could finish his question, his mother
      pressed her finger against his lips warningly. Above the roar of what was
      going on in the clouds, she had heard another and more alarming sound; the
      front-door closed quietly, a match struck and then the slow deliberate
      tread of someone groping up the stairs.

    <p>
      HE tread reached the landing and proceeded to mount higher. Then it
      hesitated. Another match was struck and it commenced to descend. On
      arriving at the landing again, it halted uncertain. The handle of the door
      was tried. The door swung open and a man peered across the threshold. No
      one spoke. The little lady on the couch drew Joan closer to her side and
      held her breath, hoping that the man might not observe them and that, when
      he had gone, they might escape. But the man did not go, he stood there on
      the alert, listening and searching the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Robbie who spoke first. He had thrust his hands deep into his
      knickerbockers' pockets to gain courage. &ldquo;What do you want? We think you
      might speak,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man laughed pleasantly. &ldquo;I'm sorry if I've frightened you. I didn't
      know that anyone was here. I thought this was an empty house. Perhaps you
      weren't aware of it, but you'd left your front-door open.&rdquo; Then, because
      no one replied, he added, &ldquo;It's all right now; it's closed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wasn't looking at Robbie any longer. He was trying to probe the shadows
      by the fireplace, where he had caught the rustle of a woman's dress. He
      had caught something else&mdash;the faint sweet fragrance of Jacqueminot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've alarmed you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm a stranger in London and I couldn't find
      any way out of your square. I strayed into your house for shelter. I'm
      sorry I intruded. Good-night to you all, however many there are of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was actually going. It was impossible to see what he looked like, but
      he was evidently well-mannered and a gentleman. Suddenly to the lady in
      the lonely house, from being a creature of dread, he became a heaven-sent
      protector. Who could tell how many less desirable visitors might not call
      before the raid was ended? The care-taker might return. Were that to
      happen, it would be much more comfortable to have this male trespasser
      present to help make the explanations. Just as he was withdrawing, the
      lady rose from the shabby couch and called him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please, we'd much rather you didn't go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who are we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I and Robbie and Joan. We did the same thing as you. The house doesn't
      belong to us. We got caught, just as you did. We were terribly scared
      and... and it's creepy being in an empty, strange house where you haven't
      any right to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though she could only see the blur of him, she could feel the smile that
      was in his eyes when she had finished her appeal. And it was an appeal,
      eager and nervous and tremulous. The tears in her voice said much more
      than the words. As he turned on his heel, she heard the jingle of his
      spurs and guessed that he was a man in khaki.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm on my way to France,&rdquo; he said, speaking slowly; &ldquo;I only landed
      yesterday. I was lonely too; I didn't know a soul. A queer way to make a
      friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he stepped into the room, the light from the windows fell on him; he
      was dressed in the uniform of an American officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which are you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I've heard only your voice as yet. I'll do
      anything I can to help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little lady held out her hand, but her face was still in shadow. It
      was a very tiny hand. &ldquo;It's good of you to be willing to stay with us,&rdquo;
       she said gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that point their conversation languished. The circumstances were so
      unprecedented that they were at a loss what to say or how to act. It was
      he who broke the awkward silence: &ldquo;We ought to be able to rouse this fire
      with a little effort.&rdquo; He bent over it, trying to pull it together. &ldquo;We
      need more coal. If you'll excuse me and won't be frightened while I'm
      gone, I'll run down and see what I can forage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed a long time that he was gone&mdash;so long that she had begun to
      be afraid that he'd taken his chance to slip out. She wouldn't have blamed
      him. In the last two years, since she'd been by herself, she'd become used
      to men doing things like that. She had ceased to bank overmuch on
      masculine chivalry. Few men had leisure to expend on a woman, however
      charming and beautiful, whose children had always to be included in the
      friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had made quite sure that he was no more chivalrous than other
      men, she heard him laboriously returning. He came in carrying a scuttle in
      one hand and some bundles of wood in the other. &ldquo;And now we'll pull down
      the blinds,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and make a blaze and get her going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On his knees before the hearth he started to work, ramming paper between
      the bars, piling sticks criss-cross and using his cheeks as bellows. In
      the intervals between his exertions he chatted, &ldquo;I'm no great shakes at
      house-work. You mustn't watch me too closely or laugh at me. I'll do
      better than this when I've been at the Front, I guess. Are these your
      kiddies?... I suppose your husband's over there, where I'm going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, so you've got him back! You're lucky. Is he wounded or has he got a
      staff job in England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll never come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused in what he was doing and sat gazing into the flames which were
      licking at the wood. He hung his head. He ought to have thought of that;
      in the last few years so many Englishmen were dead. And then there came
      another reflection&mdash;the picture of what it must have cost her husband
      to say good-bye to his wife and children, and go marching away to
      anonymous glory. He wasn't married himself, but if he had been... It took
      enough bolstering up of one's courage to go when one was single; but to go
      when one was married... And yet selfishly, ever since he had put on khaki
      his paramount regret had been that, were he to peg out, he would leave no
      one to carry on in his stead. This air-raid was his first remote taste of
      warfare; within the next few weeks he was to know it in its full fury.
      What had impressed him most was the difference between war as imagined and
      witnessed. As imagined it had seemed the most immense of sports; as
      witnessed it was merely murder. Just before he had sought shelter he had
      seen where a bomb had fallen. People had been killed&mdash;people not so
      different from the mother and children hiding in this house. The
      suddenness of extinction had made him feel that in the game of life he had
      somehow &ldquo;missed out.&rdquo; There would be no woman to think of him as &ldquo;her man&rdquo;
       were he to go west. And here was the woman's price for such caring, &ldquo;He'll
      never come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned his head slowly; by the light of the crackling wood for the
      first time he saw her. The little boy was lying wearied out, with his head
      bowed in her lap. The little girl sat drowsing against her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      She herself was leaning forward, gazing at and beyond him with a curious
      air of resigned intensity. She seemed to him to be listening for someone,
      whom she knew in her heart was never coming. He noticed the white
      half-moon of her shoulders faintly showing beneath her chinchilla wrap. He
      noticed her string of perfect pearls, the single ring on her hand and the
      expensive simplicity of her velvet gown. He was sufficiently a man of the
      world to make a guess at her social station. But it wasn't her beauty or
      elegance that struck him, though they were strangely in contrast to the
      empty room in which she sat; it was her gentleness and expression of
      patient courage. He knew, as surely as if she had told him, that this
      empty room, in which he had found her, was the symbol of her days. It was
      with her as it was with himself; there was no man to whom she was &ldquo;his
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've hurt you by the impertinence of my questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and shook her head. &ldquo;You've not hurt me. Don't think that. I
      shouldn't like you to think that you'd hurt me or anything that would make
      you sad. Are you going to France soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you won't be here for Christmas. I wonder where you'll spend it.
      Perhaps next Christmas the war will be ended and you'll...&rdquo; She caught the
      instant change in his expression. She had seen that look too often in
      soldiers' eyes when the future was mentioned not to know what it meant.
      She laid her hand on his arm impulsively. &ldquo;But everyone who goes doesn't
      stay there. You'll be one of the lucky ones. You'll come back. I have that
      feeling about you. I know what's in your mind; you're a long way from
      home, you're going to face a great danger and you believe that everything
      is ended. You can only think of war now, but there are so many better
      things to do with life than fighting. All the better things will be here
      to welcome you, when you return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found himself talking to her in a way in which he had never spoken to
      any woman. Afterwards, when he recalled their conversation, he wondered
      why. Was it because she had filled him with so complete a sense of rest?
      One didn't have to explain things to her; she understood. He asked her how
      it was that she understood and she replied, &ldquo;You don't have to go to war
      to learn how to endure. You can stay at home and yet beat off attacks in
      the front-line trench. We women defeat despair by keeping on smiling when
      there's nothing left to smile about, and by wearing pretty dresses when
      there's no one to take a pride in what we wear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He retorted unguardedly, as he felt. &ldquo;But there must be heaps of people
      who take a pride in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so? You're unspoilt and generous. Life's a wonderful dream that
      lies all before you. You haven't known sorrow. Do you know what you seemed
      to be saying when you spoke to me through the shadows? 'Everybody has
      always loved and trusted me, so you love and trust me, too.' If it hadn't
      been for that, that I saw that you'd always been loved and were lonely for
      the moment, I shouldn't have sat here talking with you for the last hour.
      You'll get everything you want from life, if you'll only wait for it.
      You'll come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he sat at her feet in the firelight, she had the knack of making him
      feel like a little boy who was being comforted. She kept aloof from him,
      but she mothered him with words. He found himself glancing up at her
      furtively to make sure that she wasn't as old as she pretended. She wasn't
      old at all&mdash;not a single day older than himself. He turned over in
      his mind what she had said about having no one to be proud of her. He
      would have given a lot for the chance to be proud of her himself. But he
      was going to France tomorrow&mdash;there was no time left for that. With
      so much fighting and dying to be done, it seemed as though there would
      never again be time for anything that was personal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clamour in the skies had died down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crash of guns had been growing infrequent; now it had subsided. The
      drone of planes could be no more heard. The invader had been driven back;
      hard on his heels our aerial cavalry were following across the Channel,
      awaiting their moment to exact revenge when he tried to land.

      The restored normality seemed to rouse her reserve. Lifting the sleeping
      head from her lap, she whispered, &ldquo;Wake up, Robbie; we can go home now.
      It's all over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer had risen and stood leaning against the mantel, &ldquo;So it's
      good-bye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've made me happy when I least expected to be happy. Shall we meet
      again, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at his seriousness. &ldquo;Perhaps. One never knows what the good God
      will allow. We didn't expect to meet tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was sensitive to her evasion and laughed, pretending to make light of
      it. &ldquo;We don't want them to think they've had burglars. We had better leave
      something for the coals we've burned.&rdquo; He placed a pound note on the
      mantel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking Joan in his arms and going first, he led the way down the stairs.
      When they were out of the hall and the front-door had closed behind them,
      he left the little group on the steps and went in search of a taxi. After
      a lengthy expedition he found one and, by promising an excessive fare,
      induced the driver to accompany him back. He knew neither the name of the
      square nor the number of the house, so he had to keep his head out of the
      window and shout directions. On entering the square he searched the
      pavement ahead, but could catch no sign of his recent companions. He
      halted the cab against the curb at the point where he thought he had left
      them; he was made certain that it was the point when he saw the notice TO
      LET. Perhaps the caretaker had come back and invited them to enter till he
      returned. He rang the bell and knocked vigorously. The driver was eyeing
      him with suspicion. When his repeated knockings were unanswered, he got
      into the taxi and ordered him to move slowly round the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had completely vanished. Either she had picked up a conveyance for
      herself, while he had been engaged in his search, or else she had lost
      faith in him and had taken it for granted that he had deserted her. He did
      not know her name. She had given him no address. Tomorrow night he would
      be in France. He had neither the time nor the necessary information to
      hunt for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply to the driver's request for further instructions, he growled the
      name of his hotel. Then he spread himself out on the cushions and gave way
      to disconsolate reflections. The night was full of smoke and heavy with
      the smell of a bonfire burnt out. Things had become again uninteresting.
      He told himself that the most wonderful hour of his life was ended.

      HRISTMAS came and went unmerrily. The old woman who took care of me had
      known better days; she stayed in bed in an effort to forget. Next door,
      but one, a son had returned unexpectedly from the trenches. There were
      laughing, dancing and piano playing. I tried to share their happiness; but
      happiness isn't the same when it is borrowed second-hand. My rooms were
      cheerless and empty of all sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      I kept thinking of my air-raid visitors, wondering where they were and
      hoping that the American officer had re-found the little lady. If he had,
      I felt sure he would be good to her. I told myself a foolish fairy-story,
      as old houses will, of how, when the war was ended, they would drive up to
      my door together, as if by accident, and exclaim, &ldquo;Why, it's the little
      house where we first met!&rdquo; Then the TO LET sign would be taken down and,
      having fetched Joan and Robbie, we would all live together forever. With
      luck and love we might have smaller feet to toddle up and down my stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      January, February, March commenced and ended, and the TO LET sign was
      still there. It seemed that nobody would ever want me. It was April now;
      to their nests in the railed-in garden of the square the last year's birds
      were coming back. Trees had become a mist of greenness. Tulips and
      daffodils were shining above the ground. In the window-boxes of other
      houses geraniums were making a scarlet flare. Without warning the dream,
      which had been no more than a dream, began to become a fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been drowsing in the sun, taking no notice of what was happening,
      when I was suddenly awakened by a sharp rat-a-tat-tat. I came to myself
      with a start to find that the little lady, unaccompanied, was standing on
      my steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knocked again and then a third time. There could be no doubt about her
      determination to enter. At last the old woman heard her and dragged
      herself complainingly up from the basement. When the door had been
      narrowly opened, the little lady pushed it wider and stepped smartly into
      the hall with an exceedingly business-like air. &ldquo;I have an order from the
      agents to view the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm 'ard of 'earing. Wot did yer say? Speak louder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an order from the agents to look over the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's see your order?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the caretaker fumbled for her spectacles, she went on talking. &ldquo;You
      won't like it. There's no real sense in your seeing it. It ain't much of a
      'ouse&mdash;not modern, too little and all stairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It made me furious to hear her running me down and to have no chance to
      defend myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, I rather like it and I think I'll see it,&rdquo; the little lady
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went from room to room, making notes of the accommodations and
      thinking aloud as she set them down. &ldquo;Four floors beside the basement. On
      the top floor two bedrooms; they'll do for Robbie and Joan and nurse. On
      the next floor one bedroom and a bathroom; I'll have that for myself. On
      the second floor one big room, running from front to back; that's where
      we'II have the parrot and the piano, and where I'll do my sewing. On the
      ground-floor a dining-room in front and a bedroom at the back; the bedroom
      at the back will do for cook. I won't have anyone sleeping below-stairs.
      It's a very wee house, but tremendously cosy. And what pretty views&mdash;the
      garden in the square in front, and the old grey church with its graveyard
      at the back! It's all so green and quiet, like being in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      She had far out-distanced the caretaker, hurrying over the first two
      floors that she might get to the top by herself. Now, as she descended,
      she inspected each room more leisurely. As yet she had said no word that
      would indicate that she had recognised me. I wondered what her motive had
      been in coming; whether she had deliberately sought me or stumbled on me
      simply by accident. I would have known her anywhere, though I had been
      blind and deaf, by the fragrance of Jacqueminot that clung about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had come to the tiny landing on the second floor, when something
      familiar in her surroundings struck her. She stood there holding the
      handle of the door and wrinkling her forehead. &ldquo;It's odd,&rdquo; she whispered;
      &ldquo;I can't understand it.&rdquo; She turned the handle and entered. The room smelt
      stuffy; its windows had not been opened since she was last there. The
      sunlight, pouring in, revealed motes of dust which rose up dancing every
      time she stirred. In the grate were the accumulated ashes of many fires.
      Drawn across the hearth was the shabby couch. Nothing had been altered
      since she had left it. She passed her hand across her eyes, &ldquo;It can't be;
      it would be too strange to find it like that.&rdquo; Then she started to
      reconstruct the scene as she remembered it. &ldquo;Robbie was there against the
      window, asking how many Huns his daddy had brought down, and I was sitting
      here in the shadow, when quite suddenly we heard his tread on the stairs.
      The door opened; he said something about being sorry that he'd frightened
      us, and then.... Why yes, I'm positive.&rdquo; She stepped out onto the verandah
      and stood looking down into the square. When she turned to re-enter her
      eyes were moist and shining. &ldquo;You <i>are</i> the little house. Oh, little
      house, I've dreamt of you so often. Does he dream of you too, where he is
      out there? Was I right to run away and to doubt him? If you had a tongue
      you could tell me; did he say hard things about me when he found me gone
      on coming back?&rdquo;

      WO weeks later they took possession of me. They did it with so much
      friendliness that at the end of a month it was as though we had always
      lived together. Even the furniture fitted into all my odd nooks and angles
      as if it had been made especially for me. And, indeed, it might have been,
      for most of it was created in the reign of Queen Anne, at which period my
      walls were, as one might say, feeling their legs. It was very pleasant
      when night had settled down and everyone was sleeping, to listen to the
      conversations which were carried on between the new-comers and my own
      floors and stairs. One grandfather's clock was particularly interesting in
      his reminiscences. He had told the time to Dr. Johnson and had ticked away
      the great lexicographer's last hours. On this account he was inclined to
      be amusingly self-important; it was a permanent source of grievance with
      him that, so far as the present generation was concerned, his pedigree was
      unknown. There were times when he would work himself into such passions
      that his weights would drop with a bang. He was always sorry for it next
      morning and ashamed to face the little lady. As she came down to
      breakfast, she would catch sight of his hands and say, &ldquo;So the poor old
      clock has stopped again! The old fellow's worn out. We shall have to send
      him to the mender's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it is hardly fair to repeat this gossip about one piece of the
      furniture, for everything, myself included, was old; whether we were
      tables, chairs or stair-cases, we all had our crochets and oddities. But,
      however much we differed among ourselves, we were united in adoring the
      youth of the little lady and her children. More than any of us the
      whispering parrot adored her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whispering parrot was a traveller. He had come from Australia fifty
      years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      He played so indispensable a part in producing the happy ending that he
      deserves an introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been the gift of the children's grandfather, a retired General. His
      plumage was Quaker grey, all except his breast and crest which were a
      wonderful rose-pink. He had black beady eyes which took in everything;
      what they saw, he invariably remembered. He had a confidential, hoarse way
      of speaking, that never rose above a whisper. When you heard him for the
      first time you supposed that he had a bad sore throat. He had a favorite
      question which he asked whenever he thought he was not being paid
      sufficient attention, &ldquo;What shall we talk about?&rdquo; He would ask it with his
      head cocked on one side, while he rubbed his feathers up and down the
      bars. &ldquo;What shall we talk about?&rdquo; he would ask the little lady as she sat
      sewing beneath the lamp of an evening. She was always by herself when the
      children had been put to bed. She had no callers and never went anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk about Polly!&rdquo; she would say. &ldquo;I don't know, you good grey bird. Did
      you think I was lonely? Well, let's see! Who loves Mummy best? Can you
      answer me that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he would cock his head still farther on one side and pretend to think
      furiously. She would have to ask him several times before he would attempt
      an answer. Usually, when he got ready, he would clear his throat and
      whisper, &ldquo;The dustman.&rdquo; After which he would laugh as though his sides
      were aching: &ldquo;What a naughty Polly! What a naughty Polly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She would maintain a dignified silence till she had emptied her needle.
      Then she would glance at him reproachfully, &ldquo;Think again, Mr. Impudence&mdash;not
      the dustman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he would think again, and having clambered all over his cage and hung
      upside down to amuse her, would hazard, &ldquo;Polly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Polly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he would make any number of suggestions, though he knew quite well
      the answer she required. After each wrong guess he would go off into gales
      of ghostly merriment. At last he would say very solemnly, &ldquo;Robbie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Robbie,&rdquo; she would reply and scratch his head; after which the game
      was ended. Soon she would fold away her work, put out the lights and climb
      the narrow stairs to her quiet bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed very sad that, when she was so young, she should have to spend
      so many hours in talking to a rascally old bird. One can be young for so
      short a time. How short, those who are old know best.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were evenings, however, when, after the parrot had answered
      &ldquo;Robbie,&rdquo; she would whisper, &ldquo;I wonder!&rdquo; and clasp her hands in her lap,
      gazing straight before her. On these evenings she would sit very late and
      would look down at her feet from time to time, as though expecting to see
      someone crouching there. Taxis would chug their way into the square and
      draw up at one or other of the dolls' houses. The taxi door would open and
      after a few seconds close with a bang. There would be the rustle of a
      woman's dress and the tripping of her slippered feet across the pavement;
      the bass muttering of her husband paying the driver; laughter; the
      rattling of a key in the latch; and silence. The little lady would sit
      quite motionless, listening to the secret homecomings of lovers. Then at
      last she would nod her head, &ldquo;You're right, Polly, I expect. There's no
      one else. No doubt it's Robbie who loves me best.&rdquo;

      UT it wasn't Robbie. The diningroom window was the first to make the
      discovery. Being on the ground-floor, it gazes across the pavement under
      the trees and sees many things after nightfall which are missed by the
      upper storeys. The first and second time that something unusual happened I
      was not told; not until the third time was I taken into the secret. The
      dining-room window does most of the watching for the entire house; it sees
      so much that it has learnt to be discreet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Armistice night when the unusual happening first occurred. London
      had gone mad with relief from suspense. Wherever a barrel-organ could be
      found people were dancing. Where more suitable music was not available,
      tin-cans were being beaten with a dervish, rhythmic monotony. Dance the
      people must. Their joy had gone into their feet; they could not convince
      themselves that peace had come till they had danced themselves to a
      standstill. They invented impromptu steps, dancing twenty abreast in the
      open spaces, humming any tune that caught their fancy, with their arms
      linked in those of strangers. But there were no strangers that night;
      everyone was a friend. Top-hats, evening-dress, corduroys and privates'
      uniforms hobnobbed together. A mighty roar of laughter and singing went up
      from thousands of miles of streets, dim-lit and dusk-drenched to ward off
      the ancient peril from the air. How suddenly unmodern peril had become!
      All London laughed; all England; all the world. The sound reached the
      Arctic; polar bears lumbered farther northward, stampeded by the strum of
      our guffaws. If there were inhabitants on Mars, they must have heard. The
      war was won. The news was so incredible that we had to make a noise to
      silence our doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything that could rejoice was out under the stars making merry. We had
      hidden so long, walked so stealthily, wept so quietly, hated so violently
      that our right to be happy was almost too terrible to bear. We expressed
      our joy foolishly, hysterically, inadequately by shouting, embracing,
      climbing lamp-posts, riding on the roofs of taxis. What did it matter so
      long as we expressed it and brought the amazing truth home to ourselves?
      The last cannon had roared. The final man had died in battle. The wicked
      waste of white human bodies was ended. There would be no more rushing for
      the morning papers and searching the casualty lists with dread; no more
      rumours of invasions; no more musterings for new offensives. The men whom
      we loved were safe; they had been reprieved at the eleventh hour. We
      should have them home presently, seated by their firesides. It seemed like
      the fulfilment of a prophet's ecstasy; as though sorrow and crying had
      passed away and forever there would be no death.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two people who did not dance, climb lamp-posts, beat tin-cans
      and ride on the roofs of taxis that night. Perhaps they were the only two
      in London; they were both in Dolls' House Square. The little lady was one.
      She had tucked Joan and Robbie safely in their beds. She had kissed them
      &ldquo;Good-night&rdquo; and turned the gas on the landing to a jet. She had gone part
      way down the narrow stairs and then... and then she had come back. She had
      picked up Joan and carried her into Robbie's room. When the two heads were
      lying close together on the pillow, she had seated herself in the darkness
      beside them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little boy stretched up his arms to pull her down; she resisted. His
      hands wandered over her face and reached her eyes. They were wet. His
      heart missed a beat. He knew what that meant. So often in the dark, dark
      night he had wakened with the sure sense that she was crying and had
      tiptoed down the creaking stairs to creep in beside her and place his
      small arms tightly about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind; you have me, Mummy.&rdquo; That was what he always said. He
      whispered it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have my wee man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And me, Mummy,&rdquo; Joan murmured sleepily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mummy knows. She has you both. Don't worry about her. She's feeling silly
      tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you're happy?&rdquo; Joan questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, happy for so many little boys and girls whose soldier daddies will
      be coming back to them soon. Don't talk any more. Go sleepy-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Robbie knew that it wasn't happiness that made her cry; he knew that
      she was crying because she had no soldier to come back. What could he say
      to comfort her? His eyes grew drowsy while he thought about it. He waited
      till Joan was in Sleepy-bye Land, then with an effort he opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mummy, do you know what I'd like best for Christmas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were sleeping. Don't tell me now. There's heaps of time.
      It's six weeks till Christmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Joan and I have talked about it,&rdquo; he persisted. &ldquo;We don't want him,
      if you don't want him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he, dear? If he doesn't cost too much, you shall have him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robbie procrastinated now that he had brought his mother to the point of
      listening. It was a delicate proposal that he was about to make. &ldquo;I don't
      know whether you can get one,&rdquo; he hesitated. &ldquo;A boy at my school got one
      without asking, and it wasn't even Christmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was sitting up in bed now, very intense and serious, and very much
      awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you've not told me yet what it is you want. If you don't tell me, I
      can't say whether I can afford it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slipped her arm about the square little body and feeling how it
      trembled, held it close against her breast. He hid his face in the hollow
      of her neck. &ldquo;Robbie's place,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;If it's difficult to say,
      whisper it to mother there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lips moved several times before a sound came and then, &ldquo;If it isn't
      too much trouble, we should like to have a Daddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Against his will she held him back from her, trying to see his eyes. &ldquo;But
      why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was he who was crying now. &ldquo;Oh Mummy, I didn't mean to hurt you.... To
      be like all the other little boys and girls.&rdquo; When at last he was truly
      asleep and she had come down to the lamp-lit room in which she sewed, she
      did not take up her work. The parrot tried to draw her into conversation
      with his eternal question, &ldquo;What shall we talk about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing tonight, Polly,&rdquo; she said. Presently she crossed the room and,
      pulling back the curtains, stood staring out into the blackness. So her
      children had felt it, too&mdash;the weight of loneliness! She had tried so
      hard to prevent them from sharing it; had striven in so many ways to be
      their companion. Try as she would, she could never make up for a father's
      absence. She could never give them the sense of security that a man could
      have given without effort, even though he had loved them less. It was a
      bitter realisation&mdash;one which vaguely she had always dreaded must
      come to her. It was doubly bitter coming to her now, on a night when all
      the world was glad. She might be many things to her children; she could
      never be a man.... What did Robbie think? That you bought a father from an
      agency or engaged him through an advertisement? She smiled sadly, &ldquo;Not so
      easy as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we talk about?&rdquo; asked the parrot.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew the curtains together, extinguished the lights and groped her way
      up to bed.

      But her eyes had not peered far enough into the blackness. There was
      another person in London who had not danced or climbed lamp-posts or
      ridden on the roofs of taxis that night. For three hours he had watched
      the little house from the shadow of the trees across the road. From the
      pavement, had you been passing, you would hardly have distinguished him as
      he leant against the garden-railings. The only time he gave a sign of his
      presence was when the red flare of his cigarette betrayed him. He did not
      seem to be planning harm to anyone; he could not have done much harm in
      any case, for the left sleeve of his coat hung empty. He was simply
      waiting for something that he hoped might happen. At last his patience was
      rewarded when she drew aside the curtain and stood with the lighted room
      behind her, staring out into the blackness. Only when she had again hidden
      herself and all the house was in darkness, did he turn to go. He was there
      the next night and the next. It was after his third night of watching that
      the dining-room window told me.

      HE fourth night he was there again. By this time everything in the house,
      from the kettle in the kitchen to the carpet on the topmost landing, was
      aware that a one-armed man was hidden beneath the trees across the road,
      watching. The whole house was on the alert, listening and waiting&mdash;everybody,
      that is to say, except the people most concerned, who inhabited us. It
      seemed strange that they alone should be in ignorance. The grandfather
      clock did his best to tell them. &ldquo;Beware; take care. Beware; take care,&rdquo;
       he ticked as his pendulum swung to and fro. They stared him in the face
      and read the time by his hands, but they had no idea what he was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could it be that the watching man wanted? Whatever it was, he wanted
      it badly, for it was by no means pleasant to stand motionless for several
      hours when the November chill was in the air. Nor did he seem to find it
      pleasant, for every now and then he coughed and shook himself like a dog
      inside his coat, and sunk his chin deeper into his collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been there since six o'clock. He had seen the cook and the
      housemaid come up the area-steps and meet their respective sweethearts
      under the arc-light at the end of the square. There was only one other
      grown person in the house beside the little lady&mdash;Nurse; and Nurse
      had been in bed since the afternoon with a sick headache. He could not
      have known that. It was at precisely eight that he consulted his luminous
      wrist-watch, crossed the road, hesitated and raised the knocker very
      determinedly, as if he had only just arrived and had not much time to
      spare. <i>Rat-tat-tat!</i> The sound echoed alarmingly through the
      silence. The little lady dropped her sewing in her lap and listened. The
      sound was repeated. <i>Rat-tat-tat!</i> It seemed to say, &ldquo;Come along.
      Don't keep me waiting. You've got to let me in sooner or later. You know
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can't be the postman at this hour,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;and yet it sounds
      like his knock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laying her work on the table beneath the lamp, she rose from her chair and
      descended. She opened the door only a little way at first, just wide
      enough for her to peer out, so that she could close it again if she saw
      anything disturbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you do live here!&rdquo; The man outside spoke gladly. &ldquo;I guessed it could
      be no one else the moment I saw that the house was no longer empty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened the door a few more inches. His tone puzzled her by its
      familiarity. His face had not yet come into the ray of light which slanted
      from the hall across the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't recognise me?&rdquo; he questioned. &ldquo;I called to let you know that I
      did fetch that taxi. It's been on my mind that you thought I deserted you.
      Taxi-cabs were hard to find in an air-raid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flung the door wide. &ldquo;Why it's&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She didn't know how to call him&mdash;how to put what he was into words.
      He had been simply &ldquo;the American officer&rdquo;&mdash;that was how she had named
      him in talking with the children. He had been often remembered, especially
      during the fireside hour when in imaginary adventures he had been the hero
      of many stories. How brave she had made him and how often she had feared
      that he was dead! There were other stories which she had told only to
      herself, when the children were asleep and the house was silent. And there
      he stood on the threshold, with the same gallant bearing and the same
      eager smile playing about his mouth. &ldquo;I've always been loved and trusted;
      you love and trust me, too&rdquo;&mdash;that was what his smile was saying to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heart was beating wildly; but nothing of what she felt expressed
      itself in what she said. &ldquo;I'm by myself. I've let the maids go out. I'm
      terribly apologetic for having treated you so suspiciously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed and stepped into the hall. &ldquo;I seem fated to find you by
      yourself; you were alone last time. I'm in hospital and have to be back by
      ten. Won't you let me sit with you for half an hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had begun to remove his top-coat awkwardly. His awkwardness attracted
      her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please let me do that for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm learning to manage. It's all right.... Well, if you must.
      Thanks.&rdquo; She didn't dare trust herself. There was a pricking sensation
      behind her eyes. She motioned to him to go first. As she followed him up
      the stairs, she gazed fixedly at his flattened left side, where the sleeve
      was tucked limply into the tunic-pocket. She knew that when she was again
      face to face with him she must pretend not to have noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered the room and stood staring round. &ldquo;The same old room! But it
      didn't belong to you then. How did you manage it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily, but not on purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly, not on purpose?&rdquo; His tone was disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not on purpose. I didn't know the name of the square or the number of
      the house that night. I stumbled on it months later by accident. It was
      still to let.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you took it? Why did you take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I'd liked it from the first and it suited me,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;Why
      else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought perhaps...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, say it. You're just like Robbie. When Robbie wants to tell me
      something that's difficult, he has a special place against which he hides
      his face; it's easier to tell me there. You men are all such little boys.
      If it's difficult to tell, you do the same and say it without looking at
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reseated herself beneath the lamp and took up her sewing. &ldquo;Now tell
      me, why did you want me to say that I took it on purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't quite know. Perhaps it was because, had I been you, I should have
      taken it on purpose. One likes to live in places where he has been happy,
      even though the happiness lasted only for an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wandered over to the couch before the fire and sat down where he could
      watch her profile and the slope of her throat beneath the lamp. The only
      sound was the prick of the needle and the quiet pulling through of the
      thread. It had all happened just as he would have planned it. He was glad
      that she was alone. He was glad that it was in this same room that they
      had met. He was glad in a curious unreasoning way for the faint fragrance
      of Jacqueminot that surrounded her. It had been just like this at the
      Front that he had thought of her&mdash;thought of her so intensely that he
      had almost caught the scent and the rustle of her dress, moving towards
      him through the squalor of the trench. Through all the horror the brief
      memory of her gentleness had remained with him. And what hopes he had
      built on that memory! He had told himself that, if he survived, by hook or
      by crook he would search her out. In hospital, when he had returned to
      England, all his impatience to get well had been to get to her. In his
      heart he had never expected success. The task had seemed too stupendous.
      And now here he was, sitting with her alone, the house all quiet, the fire
      shining, the lamp making a pool of gold among the shadows, and she, most
      quiet of all, taking him comfortably for granted and carrying on with her
      woman's work. At last he was at rest; not in love with her, he told
      himself, but at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was she who broke the silence. &ldquo;How did you know? What made you come so
      directly to this house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He met her eyes and smiled. &ldquo;Where else was there to come? It was the one
      place we both knew. I took a chance at it.&rdquo; And then, after a pause, &ldquo;No,
      that's not quite true. I was sent up to London for special treatment. The
      first evening I was allowed out of hospital, I hurried here and, finding
      that our empty house was occupied, stayed outside to watch it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why to watch it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it was a million to one that you weren't the tenant. Before I
      rang the bell I wanted to make certain. You see I don't know your name; I
      couldn't ask to see the lady of the house. If she hadn't been you, how
      could I have explained my intrusion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then you made certain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;You came to the window on Armistice night and stood for a few
      minutes looking out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember.&rdquo; She shivered as if a cold breath had struck her. &ldquo;I was
      feeling stupid and lonely; all the world out there in the darkness seemed
      so glad. I wish you had rung my bell. That was three nights ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean why did I let three nights go by. I guess because I was a
      coward. I got what we call in America 'cold feet.' I thought...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited for her to prompt him. She sat leaning forward, her hands lying
      idle in her lap. He noticed, as he had noticed nearly a year ago, the
      half-moon that her shoulders made in the dimness. She was extraordinarily
      motionless; her motionlessness gave her an atmosphere of strength. When
      she moved her gestures said as much as words. Nothing that she did was
      hurried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what you thought.&rdquo; she said quietly. She spoke to him as she
      would have spoken to Robbie, making him feel very young and little. When
      she spoke like that there was not much that he would not have told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that you might not remember me or want to see me. We met so
      oddly; after the lapse of a year you might easily have regarded my call as
      an impertinence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An impertinence!&rdquo; There were tears in her eyes when she raised her head.
      &ldquo;You lost your arm that I and my children might be safe, and you talk
      about impertinence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that!&rdquo; He glanced down at his empty sleeve. &ldquo;That's nothing. It's the
      luck of the game and might have happened to anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you lost it for me,&rdquo; she re-asserted, &ldquo;that I might be safe. You must
      have suffered terribly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing her distress, he laughed gaily. &ldquo;Losing an arm wasn't the worst
      that might have happened. I'm one of the fortunate ones; I'm still above
      ground. The thing wasn't very painful&mdash;nothing is when you've simply
      got to face it. It's the thinking about pain that hurts.... Hulloa, look
      at the time; I can just get back to the hospital by ten. If we're late,
      they punish us by keeping us in next night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the top of the stairs as she was seeing him out, he halted and looked
      back into the room. &ldquo;It's quiet and cosy in there. I don't want to leave;
      I feel like a boy being packed off to school. You can't understand how
      wonderful it is after all the marching and rough times and being cut about
      to be allowed to sit by a fire with a woman. I loved to watch you at your
      sewing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's because you're tired,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;more tired than you know. You must
      come very often and rest.&rdquo;

    <p>
      N the weeks that followed the little house came to know him well.
      Everybody in the little house treated him as though his injury were a
      decoration, which had been won especially in their defence. They were
      prouder to see him come walking up their steps with his blue hospital band
      on his remaining arm, than if Sir Douglas Haig himself had called upon
      them. Nobody took any count of the frequency of his visits&mdash;nobody
      except himself. Nobody seemed to think it strange that the moment the
      doctors had finished his dressings, he should wander off to Dolls' House
      Square. Nobody seemed to guess just how fond he was of the little lady. He
      hardly guessed himself. There were times when he wondered exactly how fond
      he was. He did not believe he was in love with her; the feeling that he
      had was too gentle. He had always understood that love was exciting,
      passionate and tumultuous with dreads, whereas in her presence he knew
      neither fears nor hesitancies. He wasn't the least in terror that he would
      lose her. He felt simply safe, the way a ship might feel when the winds
      had ceased to buffet and it lay still in a sheltered harbour on a level
      keel. This feeling of safety struck him as an extraordinary sensation to
      be produced in a soldier by a woman; he was a trifle ashamed of it, as
      though it were not quite manly.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke with her, he found himself believing with a child-like
      faith that all women were mothers and that the world was good. He knew
      that for the present he could not do without her, but he was at a loss to
      imagine what he would do with her for always. She was like religion&mdash;she
      went beyond him, was bigger and better. He only dimly understood her, but
      was comfortable in believing that everything hidden was as kind as the
      part he knew. In a strangely intimate way he worshipped her, as a child
      adores his mother, thinking her the most perfect and beautiful being in
      the world. He discovered in her a wisdom of which nothing in her
      conversation gave the least indication; her unhurried attitude towards
      life created the impression. If this were love, then all the hearsay
      information he had gathered on the subject was mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were days when, after his wound had been dressed and he had left the
      hospital, he made a pretence that he was not going to visit her. He told
      himself that he was making her a habit, and that to make a habit of anyone
      was foolish. Instead of going to Dolls' House Square, he would invent some
      urgent business and take himself off citywards. But expeditions in which
      she had no share soon grew flat. He would find himself thinking about her,
      wondering whether she was waiting for him. He would end up, as he always
      ended up, by jumping in a taxi and knocking on her door in Dolls' House
      Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never once found her out. There was invariably a welcome for him. He
      would take his seat by the fire in the quiet room and watch her sewing
      till the darkness deepened and the lamp had to be brought out. It didn't
      seem to matter much whether he talked or was silent; her contentment
      seemed complete when he was there. She made no effort to entertain him,
      which was the best proof of their friendship. She was perfectly willing
      that he should ignore her, if that was his mood, by reading the paper or
      playing with the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though she made no effort to entertain him, the entire household had
      re-organised itself in readiness for his sharp <i>rat-a-tat</i>. Everyone,
      without expressing the fact, recognised that it was nice to have a man
      about the house. When one rose in the morning, there was something to
      which to look forward now. A man dropping in, even occasionally, gave this
      group of women a sense of protection and of contact with the unwidowed
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Robbie and Joan he stood for something midway between a big brother and
      a pal. They had sharp rivalries as to who should light his cigarette. It
      wasn't easy for him to grip the box between his knees and strike the match
      with only one hand. They watched him and by anticipating his wishes tried
      to constitute themselves his missing hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were with him, the little lady withdrew into the background,
      making herself so still and self-effacing that it scarcely seemed that he
      had come to see her. It was as though she had three children; he appeared
      to be their friend much more than hers. He would carry them off to the
      Zoo, to matinees or to see the Christmas toys in the West End shops.
      Sometimes she would accompany them; more often she would listen to their
      adventures when they had returned. But she never was really left out.
      While they were absent from her, she formed the main topic of
      conversation. Of this she was well aware; if she had not been, she would
      not have been so happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a way she derived more pleasure from staying at home and picturing them
      laughing through the crowded streets, going into tea-shops, riding in
      taxis and coming back through the dusk together. The children looked so
      proud in their sole possession of a man, especially of a soldier who had
      been wounded. Had their father come through the war, that was how they
      would have looked in his company. She was glad that they should get away
      from skirts. He could give them something which it was not in her power to
      give, however much she loved them. She was only a woman. Her reward
      followed when they returned a little conscience-stricken at having left
      her, bringing with them a present as indisputable proof that she had been
      remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening in talking with her after the children had been put to bed, he
      asked her if she didn't think she ought to go out more often.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled gently, thinking how little he knew of the world. &ldquo;When you've
      not got your own man to take you, it's difficult. The world moves in
      pairs. A woman can't go to many places unaccompanied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely you don't need to. You must have quantities of friends who
      would be glad...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She cut him short. &ldquo;When a woman is left by herself, she learns a good
      many things about men that she didn't suspect when she was married. The
      men she would trust herself with have their wives or fiancées&mdash;they
      have no time to trouble over shipwrecked women like myself. And the other
      kind of men... The world has no place for a widow. It doesn't mean to be
      unkind, but it simply doesn't know what to do with her. Unmarried women
      consider her an unfair rival; they think she's seeking a second chance
      before they've had their first. In the old days India solved the problem
      by burying us with our husbands. In England they do the same thing, only
      less frankly. It's rather stupid to have to live and yet to be treated as
      though you ought to be dead. One fights against it at first; then one
      gradually becomes reconciled to be out of the running. If one's wise, she
      puts all her living into her children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's not fair,&rdquo; he spoke hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the way it happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat frowning into the fire. What she had told him had upset all his
      preconceptions about her. Without looking at her, he re-started the
      conversation. &ldquo;I've thought of you as being so happy. I always thought of
      you that way at the Front. I've pictured you as being perched high on a
      ledge out of reach of waves and storms. From the first you've given me the
      feeling that nothing could hurt or move you, and that nothing could hurt
      or move me while I was near you. It's a queer thing for a man to admit to
      a woman, but you make me feel absolutely safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not so very queer,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because that's the way you make me
      feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I? You're not laughing at me?&rdquo; He swung round, leaning over the back
      of the couch, his entire attitude one of amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      She met his surprise with a quiet smile. &ldquo;I'm perfectly serious. But you
      know the reason why we feel so safe in each other's company? It's because,
      in our different ways, we're both lonely people. We're not like the rest
      of the world; we don't move in pairs. I'm lonely because I'm a woman on my
      own, and you're lonely because you're in hospital in a foreign country. We
      met just at the time when we could give each other courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't look lonely,&rdquo; he protested; &ldquo;one always thinks of lonely
      people as being sad and untidy. You always look so terrifically
      well-groomed and expensive. You create the impression that you're either
      going to or returning from a party. I never saw you when you weren't
      self-assured and occupied. I used to wonder how you spared me so much time
      from your engagements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clever of me, wasn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of answering her, he came over and stood above where she sat
      stitching beneath the lamp. He was seeing her for the first time not as
      wise, self-reliant and fashionable, but as beautiful, alone and
      unprotected. He could almost feel the ache of the bruises she had
      suffered. He felt self-reproached; what had he given her? Up to now
      anything that he could have given had seemed too small to mention. He had
      taken from her continually, supposing that she had a surplus of
      everything. And all the while she had been sharing his own hunger for the
      presents that money cannot buy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's great to be alive, when you'd expected to be dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was her turn to be surprised. She raised her head quickly, recognising
      a new earnestness in his tone.

      &ldquo;One doesn't talk much about what happened at the Front,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but
      one can't help feeling that his life was spared for some definite purpose.
      I believe the purpose was to be happy and to make others happy. I don't
      want to hog my own pleasure any more or to trifle in the old slovenly
      ways. I want to crowd every second with gratefulness for the mere fact of
      living. That's what's been bringing me here so often. That's why I've been
      so glad to carry Joan and Robbie away. Kiddies mean so tremendously much
      more to me than they did before I nearly died. And then there's home and
      women. I took them for granted once, but now... It's like saying one's
      prayers to be in a good woman's presence. I don't know if you at all
      understand me. I'm trying to thank you for what you've done....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And there his eloquence failed, leaving him gazing down at her and
      wondering whether she thought him foolish. She patted his hand, but she
      did not meet his eyes. &ldquo;It's all right. Don't explain. I know what you're
      meaning to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; He spoke doubtfully. &ldquo;I think I was trying to ask you if we
      couldn't be happy together. I'm not married and I'm not engaged; but I'm
      not like the other men you mentioned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, I never thought you were. If I had, you wouldn't have been
      here. You're honourable all the way through; I knew that the moment I saw
      you. Does that make you feel better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed happily. &ldquo;Much. Do you know what I believe I've been trying to
      ask you through all this maze of words? If I get permission from the
      doctor to stay out late tomorrow night, would you be gay and go with me to
      a theatre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes met his with gladness. &ldquo;I should love it.&rdquo;

      HAT evening at the theatre was the first conscious step in their
      experiment of being happy together. She received word from him at
      lunch-time that the doctor's permission had been granted and that he would
      call for her at seven. The news made her as excited as if she had never
      been to a theatre before in her life. She spent the afternoon before the
      mirror, brushing and re-brushing her hair, and in laying out all the
      pretty clothes which she knew men liked. It was three years since she had
      dressed with the deliberate intent that a man should admire her. Once to
      do that had been two-thirds of her life. To find herself doing it again
      seemed like waking from a long illness; she could hardly bring herself to
      believe that the monotony of sorrow was ended and that she was actually
      going to be happy again. She had been made to feel so long that to be
      happy would be disloyalty to past affections.
    </p>
    <p>
      She locked her bedroom door, for fear any of the servants should guess how
      she was occupied. She was filled with an exultant shame that she should
      still be capable of valuing so highly a man's opinion of her appearance.
      &ldquo;But I will be happy,&rdquo; she kept telling herself; &ldquo;I have the right.&rdquo; And
      then, in a whisper, &ldquo;Oh, little house, you have been so kind. Wish me luck
      and say that he'll think me nice.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Outside in the bare black cradle of the trees the November afternoon
      faded. Sparrows twittered of how winter was almost come. Against the cold
      melancholy of the London sky, like silhouettes crayoned on a wall of ice,
      roofs and chimneys stood smudged. In flickering pin-points of
      incandescence street-lamps wakened; night came drifting like a ship into
      harbour under shrouded sails.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been sitting listening for a long time, haunted by childish fears
      that he would not come. At seven promptly a taxi panted into the square
      and drew up wheezing and coughing before the little house. Seizing her
      evening-wrap, she ran down the stairs and had her hand on the door before
      his knock had sounded. &ldquo;I didn't want to keep you waiting,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed her into the cab. With a groan and a thump the engine pulled
      itself together and they made good their escape. As she settled back into
      her corner, pulling on her gloves, she watched him. So he also had
      regarded it as a gala-night! He was wearing a brand-new uniform and had
      been at extra pains to make his boots and belt splendid and shiny. She did
      her best not to be observed too closely, for her eyes were overbright and
      her color was high. She felt annoyed at herself for being so girlish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's tremendous fun. I haven't been to the theatre in the evening
      since... for years and years,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;The war is really ended.
      I'm believing it for the first time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They dined together at Prince's to the fierce discords of Jazz music. It
      suited her mood; it was primitive and reckless. Diners kept rising between
      courses and slipping out in pairs to where dancing was in progress. The
      whole world went in pairs tonight. And she had her man; no one could make
      her lonely for just this one night. It was exciting to her to notice how
      much more they seemed to belong to each other now that they were in
      public. He felt it also, for he showed his sense of pride and ownership in
      a hundred little ways. It was good to be owned after having been left so
      long discarded. As he faced her across the table, he had the air of
      believing that everybody was admiring her and envying him his luck. She
      was immensely grateful that he should think so. It was as though he could
      hear them saying, &ldquo;How on earth did a one-armed fellow do it?&rdquo; Had they
      asked him, he could only have told them, &ldquo;The house was empty, so I
      entered.&rdquo; Yes, and even he had not guessed how empty! But what had changed
      her? Knowing nothing about the locked door and how her afternoon had been
      spent, he was puzzled. All he knew was that the woman whom he had thought
      perfect, had revealed herself as more perfect. She had become radiantly
      beautiful in a way quite new and unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the play to which they went she saw but little; all she realised was
      that it was merry&mdash;a fairy-tale of life. One does not notice much
      when the heart is swollen with gladness. People sang, and looked pretty,
      and fell in love. Everyone was paired and married before the curtain was
      rung down. Something, however, she did remember: two lilting lines which
      had been sung:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And, while the sun is shining,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Make hay, little girl, make hay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They kept repeating themselves inside her head. Unconsciously in the
      darkness as they were driving home, she started humming them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; he questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't say anything. It was just a snatch from a tune we heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it? Won't you hum it again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So in the intermittent gloom of the passing lights she tried; but for some
      reason, inexplicable to herself, it made her feel choky. She couldn't
      reach the end. Gathering her wrap closer about her, she drew the fur
      collar higher to hide the stupid tears which had forced their way into her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you're crying!&rdquo; he exclaimed with concern. &ldquo;Do tell me what's
      the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm too happy,&rdquo; she whispered brokenly. The taxi drew up against the
      pavement with a jerk. There was no knowing what he might say next to
      comfort her. She both yearned to learn and dreaded. Flight was the safer
      choice. Before he could assist her, she had jumped out. &ldquo;Come tomorrow and
      I'll thank you properly. I can't now. And... I'm sorry for having been a
      baby.&rdquo; Catching at her skirts, she fled up the steps and let herself into
      the darkened house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until his wheels had moved reluctantly away, did she climb the narrow
      stairs to the room from which she had departed so gaily. Her solitariness
      had returned. She had had her own man for a handful of hours. They were
      ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she threw off her finery, she could still hear that voice persistently
      advising,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And, while the sun is shining,

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness she flung herself down on the bed, burying her face in the
      pillow. &ldquo;I want to; oh, I want to,&rdquo; she muttered.

      OR three weeks she followed the song's advice. No one knew how long
      happiness would last. With her it had never lasted. He would leave her
      presently; already he was anticipating an early return to America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall feel terribly flat when you've gone,&rdquo; she told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'll write. I'll write you the longest letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but letters aren't the same as being together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He didn't seem to share her need of him, and it hurt. If he did share it,
      it was unconsciously. He had yet to awaken to what the need meant. She had
      allowed him to become too sure of her, perhaps; had she kept him more
      uncertain, he might have awakened. In any case, it was too late to alter
      attitudes now and to think up reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      He liked her in the jolliest kind of way as the most splendid of
      diversions; but she wasn't essential to him for all time&mdash;only for
      the present. She treasured no illusions about the longest letters. She
      knew men&mdash;the world was filled with women; out of sight would be out
      of mind. So every evening when he visited her, her heart was in her throat
      till she had made him confess that he had not yet received his embarkation
      orders. Some day he would tell her that he was going and would expect her
      to congratulate him. She would have to smile and pretend that she was glad
      for his sake. After that he would vanish and the long eventlessness would
      re-commence. He would write intimately and often at first; little by
      little new interests would claim him. There would be a blank and then,
      after a long silence, a printed announcement, curtly stating that he had
      found his happiness elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw herself growing old. The children would spring up so quickly. She
      would be left with her pride, to dress and make herself beautiful for an
      anonymous someone whose coming was indefinitely postponed. Youth would go
      from her. For interminable evenings, stretching into decades, she would
      watch afternoons fade into evenings. Everything would grow quiet. She
      would sit beneath the lamp at her sewing. The whispering parrot would take
      pity on her and croak, &ldquo;What shall we talk about?&rdquo; Even that game would
      end one day, for Robbie would become a man and marry. When that had
      happened it wouldn't be truthful for the parrot to tell her that Robbie
      loved her best. She would listen for the clock to strike, the fire to
      rustle, the coals to drop in the grate. Towards midnight taxis would enter
      the square. Lovers would alight. She would hear the paying of the fare,
      the tapping of a woman's high-heeled shoes on the pavement, the slipping
      of the key into the latch, the opening and closing of the door, and then
      again the silence. She would fold up her work, turn out the lights and
      stand alone in the darkness, invisible as a ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, but he had not sailed yet. &ldquo;Make hay, little girl, make hay.&rdquo; His
      going was still only a threat. There was time, still time. She set a date
      to her respite. She would not gaze beyond it. If she could only have him
      till Christmas!
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile he kept loyally to his contract that they should be happy
      together. He gave her lavishly of his time. If he guessed how much the
      gift meant, he said nothing to show it. He was like a great, friendly
      schoolboy in his cheerfulness; he filled every niche of her desire. Now,
      in the afternoon, when he took the children on adventures, she found
      herself included. On the return home, he shared with her the solemn rite
      of seeing them safely in bed. Then forth they would sally on some fresh
      excursion. Always and increasingly there was the gnawing knowledge that
      the end was nearer in sight&mdash;that soon to each of the habits they
      were forming they would have to say, &ldquo;We have done it for the last time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We, the bricks and mortar of the little house, watched her. We grew
      desperate, for we loved her. What we had observed and overheard by day we
      discussed together by night. If we could prevent it, we were determined
      that he should not go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, if he goes,&rdquo; creaked the staircase, &ldquo;he may return. They used to say
      in my young days that the heart grows fonder through absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish,&rdquo; banged the door on the first landing. &ldquo;Rubbish, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll go,&rdquo; ticked the grandfather clock pessimistically. &ldquo;He'll go. He'll
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if I know it,&rdquo; shouted the door and banged again.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had come to a few nights before Christmas. Which night I do not
      remember, but I recall that we had started our decorations. Mistletoe was
      hanging in the hall. Holly had been arranged along the tops of the
      picture-frames. The children had been full of whisperings and secrets.
      Parcels had already begun to arrive. They were handed in with a crackling
      of paper and smuggled upstairs to a big cupboard in which they were hidden
      from prying eyes. The children were now in bed, sleeping quietly for fear
      of offending Santa Claus. The little lady was in the room where she
      worked, checking over her list of presents. She had got something for
      everyone but Robbie; she had postponed buying Robbie's present for a very
      special reason of which we were all aware. Perhaps it was superstition;
      perhaps a desperate hope. He had told her what he wanted; it didn't look
      as if she would be able to get it. &ldquo;It's no good waiting,&rdquo; she told
      herself; &ldquo;I shall have to buy him something tomorrow.&rdquo; Just then, as if in
      answer to her thoughts, an impatient <i>rat-tat-tat</i> re-sounded. It was
      his unmistakably, but he had never come so late as this before. All day
      she had listened and been full of foreboding; she had despaired of his
      ever coming. There was an interval after the door had been opened, during
      which he removed his coat. She could picture his awkwardness in doing it.
      Then the swift, leaping step of him mounting the stairs. Why had he
      delayed so long, only to come to her at the last moment in such a hurry?
      She rose from her chair to face him, her hands clenched and her body
      tense, as if to resist a physical blow. As he appeared in the doorway his
      lips were smiling. There was evidently something which he was bursting to
      tell her. On catching sight of her face he halted. His smile faded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter? What's happened?&rdquo; She unclenched her hands and looked
      away from him. &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be something. Something's troubling you. What have you been
      doing with yourself this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her gaze came back to him. She smiled feebly. &ldquo;Wondering whether you were
      coming and worrying over Robbie's present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robbie's present! That's nothing to worry over. We'II go together and
      choose one tomorrow. I'll have time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time!&rdquo; She straightened up bravely, the way she had rehearsed the scene
      so often in her imagination. &ldquo;Then it's true. You won't be here for
      Christmas? You're sailing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her knowledge of his doings was uncanny. He came a step nearer, but she
      backed away. He realised her fear lest he should touch her. For a moment
      he was offended. Then, &ldquo;My orders came today. How did you know? It was
      what I came to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did I know!&rdquo; She laughed unsteadily. &ldquo;How does one know anything? The
      heart tells one things sometimes. You'll be busy tomorrow&mdash;so many
      other things to think about. Robbie's present doesn't matter. It's growing
      late... Good-bye.&rdquo; He stood astonished at her abruptness. What had he done
      that she should be so anxious to rid herself of him? When he did not seem
      to see her proffered hand, but stared at her gloomily, her nerves broke.
      &ldquo;Go. Why don't you go?&rdquo; she cried fiercely. &ldquo;You know you'll be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want me to go?&rdquo; he asked quietly. Had she heard her own voice, she
      would have given way to weeping. With her handkerchief pressed tightly
      against her lips, she nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned slowly, looked back from the threshold for a sign of relenting
      and dragged his way haltingly down the stairs. In the hall beneath the
      mistletoe he paused to listen. He fancied he had heard the muttering of
      sobbing. So long as he paused he heard nothing; it was only when he began
      to move that again he thought he heard it. Having flung his coat about his
      shoulders, he eased his arm into the sleeve. This wasn't what he had come
      for&mdash;a very different ending!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the chance of the little house had arrived. Windows, chairs,
      tables, walls, we had all pledged ourselves to help her. He attempted to
      let himself out; the frontdoor refused to budge. He pulled, tugged and
      worked at the latch without avail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shan't go. Shan't go. Shan't go,&rdquo; ticked the grandfather's clock
      excitedly. Then the usual thing happened, which always happened when the
      grandfather's clock got excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a horrible <i>whirr</i> of the spring running down; the weights
      dropped with a bang.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the silence that followed he listened. She thought he had gone. There
      could be no mistake now; she was crying as if her heart would break.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stairs creaked to warn her as he ascended. She could not have heard
      them, for when he stepped into the room she took no notice. She had sunk
      to the floor and lay with her face hidden in the cushions of the chair,
      with the gold light from the lamp spilling over her. For some moments he
      watched her&mdash;the shuddering rise and fall of her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me to go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The little house won't let me; it was
      always kind to us.&rdquo; And then, when she made no answer, &ldquo;It's true. I've
      got my sailing orders. But it was you who told me to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was listening now. He knew that, for the half-moon shoulders had
      ceased to shudder. The smell of Jacqueminot drew him to her. Bending over
      her, he stole one hand from beneath the buried face. &ldquo;Do I need to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And still there was no answer. It was then that the old grey parrot spoke.
      He had pretended to be sleeping. &ldquo;What shall we talk about?&rdquo; he whispered
      hoarsely; and, when an interval had elapsed, &ldquo;Robbie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little lady, who had needed to be loved, lifted up her tear-stained
      face and the wounded officer who had wanted rest, bent lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't need to go,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I came to bring you Robbie's present.
      He told me what he wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
